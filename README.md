# AudioGlobalInLocal
[NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos](https://neos.com/) that changes how the default imported audio works.
 
# What it does
It makes all imported audio clips become global but only when in range of the clip.

# Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
2. Place [AudioGlobalInLocal.dll]() into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
